## 📖 Overview

This is the official implementation of **Think2Seg-RS**, a decoupled framework for reasoning segmentation in remote sensing (RS) imagery.

Our core idea is to decouple high-level semantic reasoning from low-level geometric execution. Specifically, we train an LVLM prompter (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL) to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM2) via structured geometric prompts. Through a result-oriented reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset.  

Examples of Think2Seg-RS on the EarthReason dataset:

<!-- Large Vision–Language Models (LVLMs) hold great promise for advancing remote sensing (RS) analysis, yet existing reasoning segmentation frameworks couple linguistic reasoning and pixel prediction through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning, leading to weak geometric grounding and limited generalization across tasks. To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation. -->

## 🛠️ Setup

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thunderstring/Think2Seg-RS
cd Think2Seg-RS
```

**2. Create conda environment and install dependencies for Think2Seg-RS**

```bash
# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n think2seg-rs python=3.10
conda activate think2seg-rs
# Install dependencies for Think2Seg-RS
bash setup.sh
```

**3. Install SAM2**

**Note**: You can clone the SAM2 repository into any directory. It does not have to be inside the Think2Seg-RS project folder.

```bash
# Clone and install SAM2
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git && cd sam2
pip install -e .
# Download SAM2 Checkpoints
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
```

## 🚀 Training

Prepare the dataset before training. You can obtain the EarthReason dataset here: [EarthReason dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/earth-insights/EarthReason).

Configure the required environment variables in `src/open-r1-multimodal/run_scripts/*.sh`:

```bash
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct
export EARTHREASON_ROOT=<your_earthreason_root_path_here>
export SAM_SIZE=small
export SAM_ROOT=<your_sam_root_path_here>
export RUN_NAME=<your_sam_run_name_here>
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_api_key_here>
# set --report_to to "none" to disable wandb logging
```

Then run the bash script:

```bash
cd src/open-r1-multimodal
bash run_scripts/run_grpo_geo_ultra-qwen-3B.sh
```


## 📊 Evaluation

You can use our provided model weights: [Think2Seg-RS-3B](https://huggingface.co/RicardoString/Think2Seg-RS-3B) and [Think2Seg-RS-7B](https://huggingface.co/RicardoString/Think2Seg-RS-7B), or train your own model.  
<!-- For the 7B model, you can also try [Think2Seg-RS-7B-beta](https://huggingface.co/RicardoString/Think2Seg-RS-7B-beta), which produces better natural language outputs. -->


Set the required environment variables and run:

```bash
cd src/eval
bash run_think2seg-rs_qwen.sh
```

For zero-shot referring expression segmentation, you can first access the publicly available datasets here: [RRSIS-D](https://github.com/Lsan2401/RMSIN), [RefSegRS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JessicaYuan/RefSegRS), and [RISBench](https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/CroBIM).

Once the datasets are downloaded, configure the required environment variables and execute the corresponding bash script. For example, to run zero-shot segmentation on the RRSIS-D dataset:

```bash
cd src/eval
bash run_think2seg-rs_rrsisd-zero-shot.sh
```

### OVS44Reason two-GPU smoke test

See [OVS44Reason_GUIDE.md](OVS44Reason_GUIDE.md) for the combined three-model guide.

The adapter validates the `rgb`, `text`, and `D2mask` correspondence and pairs each
question with the answer at the same list index. The evaluator runs one
Think2Seg-RS plus SAM2 pipeline per GPU and selects distinct masks for the sample.

```bash
cd /home/Think2Seg-RS
./run_ovs44_smoke_2gpu.sh
```

Override `DATA_ROOT`, `MODEL_PATH`, `SAM_ROOT`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, or `MAX_SAMPLES` when
needed. The default result is written to
`/root/autodl-tmp/think2seg-rs/ovs44_smoke/metrics.json`.

The GRPO training smoke test uses two GPUs, LoRA, frozen vision modules, four
generations per prompt, and two gradient accumulation steps:

```bash
./run_ovs44_train_smoke_2gpu.sh
```

Set `GRAD_ACCUM` to change gradient accumulation. The LoRA adapter and training
report are written to `/root/autodl-tmp/think2seg-rs/ovs44_train_smoke`.
